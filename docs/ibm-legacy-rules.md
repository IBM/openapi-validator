### Overview
Note: At this point in time, all of the rules within the IBM Cloud Legacy Validation ruleset have either been removed or
replaced with equivalent spectral-style rules in the IBM Cloud Validation Ruleset (`@ibm-cloud/openapi-ruleset`).

Details on how to customize the new spectral-style rules can be found
[here](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator/blob/circular-refs/docs/ibm-cloud-rules.md#customization).

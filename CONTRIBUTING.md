# Code
* Our style is based on [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) recommended rules, with some minor customizations. This is auto-enforced and can usually be applied by running `npm run fix`.
* Commits _must_ follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to release versions to `npm`, update the changelog, etc. Following these guidelines is simplified by using the [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with the `cz-conventional-changelog` adapter.
* Exported functions _should_ include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) comment headers defining [@param](https://jsdoc.app/tags-param.html) and [@returns](https://jsdoc.app/tags-returns.html) values.

# Issues
* You are welcome to [submit an issue](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator/issues) with a bug report or a feature request.
* If you are reporting a bug, please indicate which version of the package you are using and provide steps to reproduce the problem.
* If you are submitting a feature request, please indicate if you are willing or able to submit a PR for it.

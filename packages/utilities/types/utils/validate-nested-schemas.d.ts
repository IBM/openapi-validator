/**
 * Performs validation on a schema and all of its nested schemas.
 *
 * This function is useful when a certain semantic quality is required for every composite schema
 * nested by a schema. The `validate` function passed to this function must itself be
 * "composition-aware." Usually this means it will use other utilities (such as `getSchemaType()` or
 * `schemaHasConstraint()`) to determine the semantic qualities of a composite schema.
 *
 * For example, if a rule enforced that all of an object schema's properties be required, this
 * function could be passed a validation function that itself used the composition-aware
 * `getPropertyNamesForSchema()` and `schemaRequiresProperty()`.
 *
 * Nested schemas include `property`, `additionalProperties`, and `patternProperties` schemas
 * (for an object schema), `items` schemas (for an array schema), plus all nested schemas of those
 * schemas.
 *
 * Nested schemas included via `allOf`, `oneOf`, and `anyOf` are validated, but composed schemas
 * are not themselves validated. By default, nested schemas included via `not` are not validated.
 *
 * The provided validate function is called with three arguments:
 * - `nestedSchema`: the nested schema
 * - `path`: the array of path segments to locate the nested schema within the resolved document
 * - `logicalPath`: the array of path segments to locate an instance of `nestedSchema` within an
 *    instance of `schema` (the schema for which `validateNestedSchemas()` was originally called.)
 *    Within the logical path, an arbitrary array item is represented by `[]` and an arbitrary
 *    dictionary property is represented by `*`.
 *
 * The provided `validate()` function is guaranteed to be called:
 * - for a schema before any of its nested schemas
 * - more recently for the schema that nests it (its "nesting parent") than for that schema's
 *    siblings (or their descendants) in the nesting tree
 *
 * However, it is not guaranteed that the `validate()` function is called in any particular order
 * for a schema's directly nested schemas.
 *
 * WARNING: It is only safe to use this function for a "resolved" schema â€” it cannot traverse `$ref`
 * references.
 * @param {object} schema simple or composite OpenAPI 3.x schema object
 * @param {Array} path path array for the provided schema
 * @param {Function} validate a `(schema, path, logicalPath) => errors` function to validate a simple schema
 * @param {boolean} includeSelf validate the provided schema in addition to its nested schemas (defaults to `true`)
 * @param {boolean} includeNot validate schemas composed with `not` (defaults to `false`)
 * @returns {Array} validation errors

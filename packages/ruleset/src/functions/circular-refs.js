/**
 * This function implements the "circular-refs" rule, which will check for
 * $refs within the API definition that form cycles, either directly or indirectly.
 * In this context, a circular ref (or cycle) would be a $ref to some sort of object (e.g. a schema)
 * where traversing the referenced object's various sub-objects (e.g. schema properties,
 * allOf/anyOf/oneOf lists, "additionalProperties", "items", etc.) leads us to a $ref that is a
 * reference to the original referenced object.
 * An example of a direct cycle would be a schema "Foo" that contains a property "foo" that is
 * an instance of "Foo" itself".
 * An example of an indirect cycle would be a "Foo" schema that contains property
 * "bar" that is an instance of the "Bar" schema, and "Bar" contains a
 * property "foo" that is an instance of the "Foo" schema.
 *
 * The way this rule is implemented is a bit odd so requires some explanation.
 * The legacy "has_circular_refs" rule used both the resolved and unresolved API definition
 * to perform its logic, where it traversed the API definition and identified $refs that form cycles.
 * Unfortunately, spectral-style rules cannot access both the resolved and unresolved
 * API definitions simultaneously, because a rule has to declare whether it should operate on
 * one or the other but can't operate on both.  Due to this constraint, this rule is defined
 * with "resolved=true" even though the "given" field indicates that the rule function should
 * be invoked for each $ref property found in the API definition.
 * The net result is that Spectral invokes the function for each $ref that survived the
 * resolution step, meaning that it could not be resolved.
 * The main (only?) reason a $ref couldn't be resolved would be if the reference constitutes a
 * cycle (a circular ref). Note that an invalid $ref (i.e. a $ref that references a non-existent
 * object) will cause Spectral to immediately report that failure and abort the validator run.
 *
 * So, with all this in mind, the logic of this rule is actually pretty simple.
 * It examines each $ref value to determine whether it is local or external.
 * We'll ignore external $refs, but for a local $ref, we'll simply return a warning and report it as
 * a circular ref.
 *
 * @param {*} $ref the $ref value
 * @param {*} path the array of path segments indicating the "location" of the $ref property within the API definition
 * @returns an array containing the violations found or [] if no violations
